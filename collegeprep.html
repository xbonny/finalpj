    <p>After studying for hours on end for the past several months, you’ve finally done it; you’ve become the valedictorian, you’ve aced your exams, and you’re ready for college apps. But in the end, it doesn’t matter; because all those achievements just put you right in the middle of the pile, and the middle of the pile is the worst place to be.</p>

    <p>This isn’t a hypothetical situation; it’s the reality for many aspiring college students. It’s well known that the key to getting accepted is standing out.
