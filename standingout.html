      <p>College has become much more competitive than it has ever been in the past; not only are there more students, but there’s also more students who are applying to college. If today’s parents or grandparents were to send in their old college applications to today’s admissions offices, there’s a high chance that the application that got them a higher education decades ago would be rejected. </p>

      <p>With so many students and so little spots, how do you get into your dream college? Everyone knows that the key to their acceptance letter is making themselves stand out, but here’s the problem: everyone else who you’re competing against is also trying to stand out, and there’s a high chance that someone else will do exactly what you. Now, instead of standing out, you’ve wasted hours of your life only to be exactly like everyone else. </p>
