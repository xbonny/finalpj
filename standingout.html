      <p>College has become much more competitive and selective than it has ever been in the past; not only are there more students, but there’s also more students who are applying to college. If today’s parents or grandparents were to send in their old college applications to today’s admissions offices, there’s a high chance that the application that got them a higher education decades ago would be rejected. </p>

      <p>With so many students and so little spots, how do you get into your dream college? Everyone knows that the key to their acceptance letter is making themselves stand out, but here’s the problem: everyone else who you’re competing against is also trying to stand out, and there’s a high chance that someone else will do exactly what you. Now, instead of standing out, you’ve wasted hours of your life only to be exactly like everyone else. </p>

      <p>Ultimately, students’ attempts to make themselves appear unique causes colleges to consider extracurriculars such as volunteering, clubs, and other school related activities. Even achieving the title of Valedictorian merely puts you into the middle of the pile with every other Valedictorian across the country. </p>

      <p>However, this often results in students trying radical and irrational application processes in order to make themselves “stand out”. In one instance, a high school student submitted a ripped up essay with the rest of his application and demanded the staff to piece his life back together. While his good marks allowed this bold attempt of standing out to work, the admissions officer, Mr. Poch, admitted that his act would not have worked if he wasn’t already an outstanding student<sup><a href = "#cite">[2]</a></sup>. In another instance, a student sent over two hundred pages of content to the University of Texas at Austin explaining the reasons why he loved the school in an attempt to be reconsidered<sup><a href = "#cite">[3]</a></sup>. While these situations aren’t common, these examples are only a small insight into how the obscure idea of “standing out” causes students act impulsively and recklessly.</p>

      <h3>Our Experiences</h3>
      <p>It’s super stressful hearing all of these things, knowing that even the extracurriculars that we partake out of passion and not gain are potentially disregarded even if we’ve put years of effort cultivating them. We know first hand that extracurriculars take up a lot of time; often, we’ve wanted to do another extracurricular, but are unable to because of time constrictions caused by other extracurriculars that we aren’t willing to give up.</p>
      <p>Ultimately, that feeling of not being able to do everything builds up: the stress and the realization that we aren’t “good enough” for the people in the admissions offices. Last year, some of us started panicking, thinking that we would never get into college because we didn’t have enough information about ourselves to present to the admission offices.</p>

      <h3>Advice</h3>
      <p>So, are all school related and therefore completely nulled. What do you do? While we haven’t quite gone through the admissions process ourselves yet, here’s some advice that we’ve picked up from other people who HAVE been through the process and KNOW how to make yourself stand out in the “right way” (oh, and also how to make you feel better about yourself :D).</p>

      <h4>Tip 1: Take your extracurriculars another step further.</h4>
      <p>Honestly, it isn’t hard to take your in-school extracurriculars outside of school. If you’re on a sports team, join a local team that actively enters competitions and tournaments around the area. One of us plays piano competitively, which is another good example of taking your skills to another level. Combining your abilities with volunteer work or charity work is also looks really good. Maybe you’re an artist, and you want to sell your work and donate what you make to charity.</p>

      <h4>Tip 2: Relating your extracurriculars to what you plan on majoring in.</h4>
      <p>This one is a little harder, since a lot of people often don’t know what they want to major in (which is okay!). But on the off chance that you DO know what your major is, than seeking a class or a camp to learn more about your desired major tells colleges that you care about what you want to learn (Girls Who Code is actually a great example!). It doesn’t need to be exclusive to learning about your major; you can also do activities that relates to what you plan on doing too.</p>
