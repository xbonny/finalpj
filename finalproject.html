    <h2>Mental health</h2>
    <p>Some of the most common mental health that students experience at some point in their life are <u>depression, anxiety, suicide, eating disorders, and addiction</u>.According to Anxiety and Depression Association of America, over 62% of college students struggling with mental health issues withdrew because of them. Anxiety is the top presenting concern among college students. The level of anxiety and stress that students (highschool and college) have is the same stress level as the mental ill people in the 60’s and 70’s.
      <p>Depression is one of the silent diseases for many college students. Depression is a medical condition that can affect a student's ability to work, study, interact with peers, or take care of themselves. Symptoms of depression may include: difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much, appetite changes, withdrawing from participating in activities once enjoyed, feelings of sadness, hopelessness, unhappiness, and difficulty concentrating on school work. They also start to have suicide thoughts.  According to The Association for University and College Counseling Center Directors, around 36% of students deal with depression and 10% have thoughts of suicide.</p>

    <h2>Freshman 15</h2>
      <p>Freshman 15 is a nickname that college freshman get because they gain “15 lbs” that year because of unhealthy eating. While the poundage doesn't always exactly ring in at fifteen, the tendency to gain is significant enough to earn itself a lasting title. While this is not always the same case to all college freshmen, some people gain more weight, some less, and some gain no extra weight at all or even lose pounds when they leave home for college for the first time. However, it's a common enough experience that it has earned a nickname that has endured through several decades, and is something to be aware of so it can be avoided. Being able to have your full independence, you might be carried away when you eat. Students tend to stress eat during testing weeks and other times where they undergo intense studying.  Also, what contributes for freshman to gain weight is the stress that they have.
</p>

    <h2>Sleep</h2>
    <p> The lack of sleep that students face is another one of the major health issues for students, with half of all students regularly reporting sleepiness during the day. Recent research on college students indicates that insufficient sleep impacts our health, moods, GPA, safety, and motivation.<a href="#cite">[1]</a><b> Sleep really matters</b>. Sleep is a necessity, yet college students often prioritize their courses to complete their degrees. This lack of sleep also puts college students at risk for other mental health issues such as depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>Not only are college students are affected by the lack of sleep, but high school students also face negative consequences.  Sleep deprivation can affect the growth of teens because growth hormones are normally released during sleep.<a href="#cite">[2]</a> Not only does the lack of sleep affect the growth hormones, but it also affects other hormones as well. The insulin hormones is a major fat-storing hormone, so when you don’t have enough sleep your insulin levels get high which makes you store more fat. Ghrelin & Leptin are the hormones that control your hunger/appetite.</p>
