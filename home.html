      <p>After studying for hours on end for the past several months, you’ve finally done it; you’ve become the valedictorian, you’ve aced your exams, and you’re ready for college apps. But in the end, it doesn’t matter; because all those achievements just put you right in the middle of the pile, and the middle of the pile is the worst place to be.</p>

      <p>This isn’t a hypothetical situation; it’s the reality for many aspiring college students. It’s well known that the key to getting accepted is standing out. However, this simply results in students doing a variety of favorable but truly mediocre tasks that become the new standard; instead of figuring out what they need to do in order to stand out, students instead spend hours trying to meet that standard.</p>

      <p>The highly competitive nature of the admissions process isn’t the only issue either; students’ testing, wellness, and expenses are also constantly at risk. </p>

      <p>Welcome to Complications, a website built by rising college students that addresses the struggle of getting into college from firsthand experiences while also giving small bits of advice to our peers.</p>
