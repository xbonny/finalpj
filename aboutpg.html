      <h3>Our Mission</h3>
      <p>As students in the middle of this process, we wanted to express our own experiences; an account that’s separate from an adult who hasn’t been through this experience for decades. While several issues regarding college life have been brought to light, we've rarely ever seen someone discuss the flaws of high school life, and that our teenage years are not always about parties and drinking, but also about high levels of stress.</p>

      <p>We’re coming to a point in our lives where we start making life changing decisions;  decisions that quite literally could change the rest of our lives depending on what we choose, and it puts a tremendous amount of stress and anxiety on us and all of our peers as we’re pressured to make the “right” decision. </p>

      <p>The problem is, the people who pressure us—our teachers, parents, and even strangers who know little about us— don’t understand the amount of stress we face as we go through this process. And while these people often wish the best for us, they don’t relieve any of the stress we feel; in fact, they do the exact opposite by setting high expectations.</p>

      <p>But that’s also why we’re here; we want to bring awareness to the way that college admissions and college lives negatively affect our lives, so that way, the people who want the best for us can try and bring the best for us, rather than worsening the situation.</p>

      <h3>About the Creators</h3>
      <p>We're a small group of rising college students, and while we originally planned to give advice to those who were going through the same process as we are, we instead decided that it would be more interesting to discuss the flaws of the college admissions process.</p>
